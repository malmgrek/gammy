Backlog ideas
=============

This is a loosely maintained list of possibly upcoming or useful, but missing,
features.

- Quick model template functions (e.g. splines, GPs)
- Support indicator models in plotting
- Fixed ordering for GP related basis functions.
- Hyperpriors for model parameters – Start from diagonal precisions. Instead of
   `(μ, Λ)` pairs, the arguments could be just BayesPy node.
- Support non-linear GAM models, fitting with autograd.
- Multi-dimensional observations.
- Dynamically changing models.
